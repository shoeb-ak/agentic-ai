# Project Title

## Description
A framework for building agents that can interact with a language model and execute actions based on user input.

## Overview / Purpose
This project aims to provide a flexible architecture for creating intelligent agents that can process natural language and perform tasks based on user commands.

## Core Architecture
The architecture consists of several key components:
- **Agent**: The main entity that processes user input and interacts with the environment.
- **Memory**: Stores past interactions and decisions made by the agent.
- **Language**: Handles the construction of prompts and parsing of responses from the language model.
- **Actions**: Defines the actions that the agent can perform.
- **Environment**: Represents the context in which the agent operates.

## Key Components
- **Memory**: Manages the agent's memory, ensuring that all content is in a compatible format.
- **Config**: Contains configuration settings for different language model providers.
- **AgentFactory**: Central registry for creating different types of agents.

## How to Run / Use the Project
1. Set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies.
2. Configure your API keys in the environment variables.
3. Create an agent using the `AgentFactory` and start interacting with it.

## How to Extend or Customize
To add new actions or modify existing ones, update the `actions` directory. You can also create new agent types by implementing the necessary logic in the `agents` directory.

## Roadmap / Future Improvements
- Implement more sophisticated memory management.
- Add support for additional language model providers.
- Enhance the agent's decision-making capabilities.
