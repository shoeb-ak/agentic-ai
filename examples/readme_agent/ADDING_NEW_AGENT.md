# Adding a New Agent

## Overview
This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to add a new agent to the project, using the example of a code review agent.

## Step 1: Create the Agent File
Create a new Python file for your agent in the `game/agents/` directory. For example, `code_review_agent.py`.

## Step 2: Define the Agent Goals
In your new agent file, define the goals for the code review agent. Goals should be defined in a list using the `Goal` class. For example:
```python
from game.goals.goal import Goal

code_review_goals = [
    Goal(
        priority=1,
        name="code_review",
        description="Review code for best practices and potential issues."
    ),
    Goal(
        priority=2,
        name="Terminate",
        description="Terminate the session when tasks are complete with a helpful summary"
    )
]
```

## Step 3: Create the Agent Function
Define a function to create the agent. This function should instantiate the `Agent` class with the goals, language, action registry, environment, and response generator. For example:
```python
from game.core.agent import Agent
from game.language.agent_language import AgentLanguage
from game.memory.memory import Memory
from game.environment.environment import Environment
from game.llm.llm_factory import LLMFactory
from game.config.config import CONFIG

from .goals import code_review_goals
from .actions import registry


def create_agent():
    llm = LLMFactory.create()

    return Agent(
        goals=code_review_goals,
        agent_language=AgentLanguage(),
        action_registry=registry,
        environment=Environment(),
        generate_response=llm
    )
```

## Step 4: Register the Agent
In the `agent_factory.py`, register your new agent by adding it to the `_registry` dictionary:
```python
from .code_review_agent import create_agent as create_code_review_agent

_registry: Dict[str, Callable] = {
    "file": create_file_agent,
    "readme": create_readme_agent,
    "code_review": create_code_review_agent,
}
```

## Step 5: Implement Actions
Define any specific actions your agent will perform in a separate actions file, similar to how it is done for existing agents.

## Step 6: Test the Agent
Finally, test your new agent to ensure it behaves as expected. You can do this by running the main application and invoking the agent.

## Conclusion
Following these steps will allow you to successfully add a new agent to the project. Make sure to follow the structure and conventions used in existing agents for consistency.
